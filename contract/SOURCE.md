Never edit the JSON to suit this repository. A change belongs to agent-hub; a new contract version (`companion-cli-v2.json`) arrives here by `hub_task_handoff`. `test/companion-cli-contract.test.ts` checks the shellQuote vectors against `src/companion.mjs` and that every field and command the reader uses is listed in the copy.
